### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project explores data related to bikecycle-sharing systems for three major cities in the United: Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  It takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present desriptive statistics.

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

This project porvides the following information:
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip
    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration
    total travel time
    average travel time
 #4 User info
    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
